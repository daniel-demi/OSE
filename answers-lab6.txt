Challenge implementations:

First challenge - challenge 1:
In order to implement this challenge we loaded and read the relevant information from the eeprom and then saved it in the 
Reading from EEPROM: We accessed the EERD register and requested the mac address by putting the corresponding in the address field and 
setting the start bit. Once the done bit was set, we were then able to read the address from the data field.
Setting the mac address in the e1000: We called the read_mac_address function and saved the results in E1000_RA
Creating syscall: Went through all the usual steps of creating a syscall and in the function itself we just called the read_mac_address function that we wrote in e1000.c
Setting mac address in lwIP: The mac address was hardwired into the file jif.c so instead we used the syscall we made to get the mac address and split it up accordingly.

Second challenge - challenge :
